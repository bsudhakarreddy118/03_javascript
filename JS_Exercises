* Write a JavaScript program to remove duplicate items from an array.

* Write a JavaScript program to list the properties of a JavaScript object?

Sample object :
var student = {
name : "David Rayy",
sclass : "VI",
rollno : 12 };

Sample Output : name, sclass, rollno

* Consider this object:

	var obj = {
	"One":"1",
	"Two":"2",
	"Three":"3",
	"Four":"4"
	}

	Convert it into JavaScript array like:
	["1","2","3","4"]


* Write a JavaScript function to sort the following array of objects by title value?

	Sample object :
	var library = [
	{ author: 'Bill Gates', title: 'The Road Ahead', libraryID: 1254},
	{ author: 'Steve Jobs', title: 'Walter Isaacson', libraryID: 4264},
	{ author: 'Suzanne Collins', title: 'Mockingjay: The Final Book of The Hunger Games', libraryID: 3245}
	];


* Write a JavaScript function that accepts two arguments, a string and a letter and the function will count the number of occurrences of the specified letter within the string.

Sample arguments : 'gmail.com', 'm'
Expected output : 2


* Consider the following object:
var myObj =
	[{'name':'Saurabh', 'age': 30, 'occupation': "Team Leader"},

	{'name':'Krishnakath', 'age': 22, 'occupation': "Programmer"},
	{'name':'Venketraman', 'age': 28, 'occupation': "Programmer"}];


 - Display all objects with occupation as 'Programmer'
 - Sort the object based on age in descending order
 - Create a new array containing only names present in myObj
 - Recreate the above array of objects into the following object of objects :
	{ 'Team Leader' : [{'name':_____________, 'age':__________},{}],
	'<anotheroccupation>': [{'name':______________, 'age':________},{}]}


* Convert the following JSON string to an object and access the value of the 'chels' property.

	var jsonStr = '{"mike":"Book","jason":"sweater","chels":"iPad"}';	

* Create a program that extracts data from the following JSON in the below format:
[
    {  author: .. , title: '' , description:'' },
    {  author: '' , title: '' , description:'' },
    {  author: .. , title: '' , description:'' },
